      <p>There are millions of people living in underserved communities with their pets in the United States. Many are forced to surrender their beloved companions to animal shelters because they are unable to afford proper care for them.One study showed that more than half of the people surrendering animals because of moving also report behavior problems. In other words, the move often isn't the real issue. Behavioral problems are the most common reason why people give up their dogs, and they are the second most common reason for cats.Animals who really touch me are the ones they call the “owner surrenders.” These are the animals who had a home and lost it, and over the years I’ve tried to understand why people abandon their animal companions.Sometimes people surrender animals because they think it’s the only possible solution. Perhaps someone with a severe cat allergy joins the household, and the family doesn’t realize that these allergies can often be treated or managed. Sometimes people are separated from their animal companions because they become too sick to care for them. Many people don’t know about the importance of advance planning for their animal family, and so their animal companions end up in the shelter. Saddest of all is when people die without having made arrangements for their companions. Often these animals are elderly and don’t adapt well to the shelter environment. Some of them never make it out of the shelter—they are scared or unfriendly, and potential adopters pass them by.One study showed that more than half of the people surrendering animals because of moving also report behavior problems. In other words, the move often isn’t the real issue.Behavioral problems are the most common reason why people give up their dogs, and they are the second most common reason for cats. Behavioral problems can be very serious, like biting or aggression in dogs. But more often they are common dog and cat issues like inappropriate elimination, destructiveness, barking or meowing, or not getting along with other animals in the home. Most behavioral issues can be corrected, but people may lack the knowledge or commitment needed to do the work.People surrendering an animal with behavior issues don’t want to hurt their animal’s chances of adoption from the shelter, so they may mislead shelter staff and explain the surrender as due to allergies or a move. This makes it even harder for the shelter to find that animal a suitable home. Or the animal might be adopted, only to be returned by the new guardian as soon as the problem behavior starts. </p>

  <h1> Ways to Help Rescue Animals</h1>

  <p>Provide transportation

When animals land a foster or adoptive home, it might not be right around the corner. Volunteers are often needed to take a dog to wherever its destination may be. Sometimes it’s a two-hour road trip, or just a leg in an eight hour drive. For those in cities, where the main mode of transportation is bus or train, this is especially helpful. And if the lucky pup does get to ride shotgun with you, it just might be the most exhilarating moment EVER.Take photos

Whether you are a professional or amateur photographer, shelters and rescues can benefit immensely from great photos. Grab your camera, and get those dogs out of their kennels. You can even hold photography workshops for shelter volunteers so they can take the best photos of the animals as possible. If you’re feeling very generous, donate your old camera equipment.Donate towels and sheets you don’t use anymore. Shelters are always in need. Bonus points for gently-used beds, collars, leashes and clothing. Just look how happy these two are.Find out what your favorite shelter or rescue needs. It could be leashes, food, cleaning supplies, or a variety of other items.Do you have room for a temporary pet? Fostering can be fun, rewarding, and challenging. By opening your home to a dog or cat, you are opening up a spot in a shelter that otherwise wouldn’t exist. The length of a foster can be a couple of days, weeks, or months. Every shelter is different, but they usually cover medical expenses and sometimes food and supplies.
